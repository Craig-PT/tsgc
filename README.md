# Time Series Growth Curves (tsgc) Package

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->


## Overview

The `tsgc` package is designed for forecasting epidemics, including the detection of new waves and turning points, using a dynamic Gompertz model. It is suitable for predicting future values of variables that, when cumulated, are subject to some unknown saturation level. This approach is not only applicable to epidemics but also to domains like the diffusion of new products, thanks to its flexibility in adapting to changes in social behavior and policy. The `tsgc` package is demonstrated using COVID-19 confirmed cases data.

## Installation

To install the latest version of the `tsgc` package from GitHub, use the following R command:
  
```r
# Install from GitHub
  install.packages("devtools")
  library(devtools)
  devtools::install_github("Craig-PT/tsgc")
```

or install from the locally downloaded package as:
  
```r
devtools::install()
```

## Usage

Here is a basic example of setting up and estimating a model with the `tsgc` package:
  
  ```r
library(tsgc)

# Load example data
data("gauteng", package = "tsgc")

# Initialize and estimate the model
model <- SSModelDynamicGompertz$new(Y = gauteng)
results <- model$estimate()

# View results
print(results)
```

## Features

- **Dynamic Gompertz Model:** Implements time series growth curve methods based on a dynamic Gompertz model.
- **Flexible Applications:** While focused on epidemics, `tsgc` is also applicable in other areas, such as marketing.
- **Reinitialization Support:** Offers functionalities for reinitializing data series and model to account for multiple waves in an epidemic.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Includes detailed examples and vignettes to guide users through forecasting exercises.

## Dependencies

This package requires R (version 3.5.0 or higher) and depends on several other R packages for handling state space models and time series data, including `KFAS`, `xts`, `zoo`, and `here`.

## Getting Help
